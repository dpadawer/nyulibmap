Simple application to tell you where to find your book in Bobst.
The images are taken from the bobst page (http://library.nyu.edu/bobcat/callno/map.html).
Simple HTML and Javascript.

Will only work with books that say "Main Collection". Others are either in a different library, or a special collection that you will need help from the librarians.
